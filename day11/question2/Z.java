/*Note: Use your own method name.
Define another interface Z which extends both the interfaces X and Y:
And place another abstract method inside this Z interface.
Create a class ZImpl as the implementation of the Z interface.
from the main method of the Demo class call the methods of interface X, Y, Z.
Note: default method of X should be overridden whereas the default method of Y
should not be overridden inside the implementation class.*/
